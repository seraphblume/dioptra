# Proposed v0.3 data collection

Status: **design only**. This document and its schema do not change the v0.2.0 UI, stored records or Cohort B export.

Machine-readable draft: [`data-collection-v0.3.schema.json`](data-collection-v0.3.schema.json)

## Collection principles

1. Store raw observations before derived values.
2. Keep objective, subjective and prescribed Rx as different stages.
3. Record method, correction condition and not-performed reason.
4. Keep OD and OS values separate; store binocular findings explicitly.
5. Use enumerated reason codes plus a note rather than inferring why a clinician changed an endpoint.
6. Avoid direct patient identifiers in the research export.
7. Stamp the schema, cohort and algorithm version on every case.
8. Do not expose a future field to the predictor until its definition, missingness and validation plan are documented.

## Minimum useful v0.3 research record

| Stage | Fields | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Study provenance | pseudonymous case ID, schema version, cohort, algorithm version, timestamps, site/instrument IDs | Prevents mixed cohorts and silent schema drift. |
| History | age, chief complaint category, primary visual task, symptoms, diabetes/hypertension/pregnancy, relevant ocular history | Clinical context and future stratification; not direct S/C/A switches. |
| Habitual correction | per-eye S/C/A, ADD, Rx age, corrected VA, satisfaction/adaptation | The procedure treats habitual correction as a major starting reference. |
| Visual acuity | distance with and without correction, near at recorded distance, pinhole with indication/status | Preserves test conditions and supports plausibility/quality checks. |
| Autorefraction | every raw reading, selected result, machine quality token as an opaque value, device/settings | Allows repeatability and cluster analysis without assuming undocumented quality semantics. |
| Other objective evidence | retinoscopy, keratometry and lensometry/habitual Rx as separate records | Enables agreement analysis without pretending the methods are interchangeable. |
| Preliminary screen | cover test, PPC, colour, externals, motility, pupils, fields, slit lamp/fundus when recorded | Reason codes and review flags; never automatic dioptric changes. |
| Subjective endpoint | starting method, monocular endpoint, best VA, binocular-balance status, dominance | Separates optical refinement from the prescription issued. |
| Near/add | tentative method/value, working distance, NRA, PRA, distance-check result, refined per-eye ADD | Supports evaluation beyond the age table. |
| Prescribed endpoint | per-eye S/C/A/ADD, ambulatory acceptance, modification reason(s) | Makes prescribing/adaptation decisions observable. |
| Derived audit | vectors, deltas and flags with rule-set version | Reproducible analysis; derived fields can be recomputed from raw values. |

## Missingness

For optional procedures, a missing value must not conflate:

- `not_indicated`
- `not_performed`
- `unavailable`
- `untestable`
- `declined`
- `unknown`

The schema uses a reusable `procedureStatus` structure for this purpose.

## Autorefractor readings

Store the printed/selected line and each repeated reading separately. An instrument's undocumented quality number should be captured as `qualityTokenRaw` with a label only when the instrument manual confirms its meaning. Instrument working distance is not the patient's preferred near working distance.

Suggested derived values, computed after collection:

- median `M`, `J0`, `J45` across readings;
- robust spread for each vector component;
- distance from machine-selected result to the robust center;
- reading count and missingness.

No dispersion threshold is fixed in this draft.

## Endpoint and prescribing reason codes

When prescribed Rx differs from the subjective endpoint, require at least one reason:

- `adaptation_large_change`
- `habitual_rx_preference`
- `binocular_comfort`
- `ambulatory_test`
- `visual_task`
- `pathology_or_health_finding`
- `clinician_judgment`
- `patient_preference`
- `other`

These codes explain the label. They must not become shortcuts that leak the final Rx into a model intended to predict the subjective endpoint.

## Transition from Cohort B

During Cohort B, continue saving the existing v0.2 record unchanged. If richer observations are collected separately, mark them `shadowOnly: true`; do not feed them to the frozen predictor. Start v0.3 development only after the Cohort B lock is closed and exported, with a documented split between model development and prospective validation.
