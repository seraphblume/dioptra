# Vertex compensation

The supplied Boston Equalens / Lumilent fitting-guide photograph has a lower-right table headed “DISTANCIA DE VERTICE A 12 mm”. It is a coarse power-conversion reference, not a method of measuring the physical vertex distance. Its printed arrows specify opposite reading directions for the minus and plus columns. The left-hand diopter/radius table and RGP fitting instructions are separate and are not implemented here.

Use the analytic formula instead of digitizing rounded table entries:

`F_target = F_source / (1 - ((sourceMm - targetMm) / 1000) * F_source)`

Distances are measured from the cornea. Convert the sphere meridian and sphere-plus-cylinder meridian independently, then reconstruct cylinder as their difference. The axis does not change. Keep full precision internally. Calculators show powers to 0.01 D and do not select available contact lens powers or prescribe a fit. Printed fitting charts can contain coarse rounding, product-specific choices or errors. They are not numerical ground truth. Regression tests use independently derived exact reference values, including high powers, both signs and both meridians; no chart-matching error allowance is used.

The calculator defaults to 12 → 0 mm (spectacle to corneal plane); either distance can be changed from 0 to 25 mm, including the reverse conversion. Blank, nonfinite, out-of-range distances and conversion through a focal singularity are rejected.

The existing v0.3 and experimental v0.4 refraction engines already normalized each AR reading to the configured 12 mm spectacle plane before vector averaging, offsets and rounding. They now call the same `js/vertex.js` implementation as the calculator. This does not change their target to 0 mm, add a second conversion, alter calibration, or rewrite historical cases. The v0.3 500-case golden baseline and v0.2 freeze remain intact. The refraction form explains its output plane. A blank instrument distance retains the existing 12 mm assumption and flag.

## Applying compensation once

The source distance describes the plane of the power currently entered, not necessarily the instrument or spectacles originally used. A prescription already expressed at the cornea has source 0 mm. Converting 0 → 0 mm leaves it unchanged. The calculator explicitly identifies same-plane passthrough and reminds users to confirm the input plane when applying a conversion. It cannot infer prior compensation from sphere, cylinder and axis alone.

Manufacturer trial-lens recommendations may already incorporate vertex conversion and available powers. Do not feed those values through an additional spectacle-to-corneal conversion. Any future table integration must record its input/output planes and compensation provenance before enabling a conversion path.

The approximately ±4 D fitting guideline concerns either principal meridian. It is not a mathematical threshold: the calculator retains exact compensation below it. Spherical equivalent is a separate approximation that removes astigmatic correction; it is not substituted for meridian-by-meridian conversion. Manufacturer multifocal additions, RGP tear-lens/base-curve adjustments, lens rotation and selection of available powers require separate fitting workflows. None changes the general refraction engine's spectacle-plane target or calibration.

Only application code, synthetic checks and this implementation explanation accompany this update. No private notes, vault paths, source attachments or patient records are included.

## Calculator workflow and refraction scope

Calculators supports separate right-eye (OD) and left-eye (OS) inputs. Either eye may be left completely blank; a partially completed eye is rejected. Both eyes share explicit source/target distances and are calculated independently. No patient-case data is imported, saved or modified. A mode/input change invalidates results; a failed eye prevents any partial result from being presented as the completed calculation.

- Spectacles → Contacts: enter the spectacle Rx and its measured vertex (default 12 mm); the corneal target is fixed at 0 mm.
- Contacts → Spectacles: enter contact lens powers at 0 mm and the intended spectacle vertex (default 12 mm).
- Custom: set both distances for a spectacle-fit change or an already-compensated power. This is axial compensation only, not a wrap/tilt/freeform lens-design calculation.

Results label each eye and output plane, show the exact optical equivalent to 0.01 D, and separately show a nearest-quarter sphere/cylinder reference with ties toward more plus. This reference is mathematical rounding, not a brand's available powers or a fitting recommendation. The original-Rx transposition and spherical equivalent remain separate. Individual and combined conversion copies carry eye and plane labels.

The main algorithm remains an autorefractor-to-spectacle estimate, normalized to its 12 mm output plane. Its ticket VD is the plane in which the device reports its powers; it is not an instruction to generate contacts. Changing this normalization would change the prediction target and invalidate calibration/comparison. No calibration, historical data, ADD or frozen engine behavior is changed by the calculator redesign.

Illustrative checks use synthetic prescriptions and independently calculated optical values. No private source text or attachments are included. The approximate 4 D clinical guideline is checked per principal meridian; no fixed claim that every lower-power conversion is below 0.18 D is made. Available powers and fitting choices remain separate from the formula.

Spectacle/phoropter vertex distances commonly fall in the 12–14 mm range. The 12 mm default is an explicit assumption, not a universal calibration. Use the device-reported or measured source distance and intended fitted spectacle distance when known; 14 mm is accepted. The engine retains its fixed 12 mm reporting plane for consistent prediction comparisons.
